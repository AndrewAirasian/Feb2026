# Andrew's README document

This will be on the third merge. I have become confident with using git add, commit, branch, checkout, and merge commands. However, at this point, I do not understand what Prof. Turner meant when he said that using the IDE and the desktop app instead of the terminal is more confusing. At some point I'm sure it will click for me.
